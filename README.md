In this challenge, I have learnt how computer vision and AI algorithms can be used to extract information from videos of football matches. The end goal of this workshop is to help coaches, football analysts, and fans by supplying them with insights about player and team performance.

Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

    Use a deep learning model to recognize players on a field.
    Translate camera coordinates to field coordinates.
    Find out what team a player plays for.
    Use a deep learning model to identify individual players with their shirt number.
    Augment the input video by adding graphical tracking information.

We will write the tracking data to a database (Autonomous Data Warehouse). You will use a number of services, such as Autonomous Data Warehouse, OCI Data Science and OCI Vision.
